## Overview

The Telegram Event Bot is a comprehensive solution for creating, managing, and monetizing events directly within the Telegram platform. It leverages Telegram's Bot API, Payment API, and Web App capabilities to provide a seamless experience for both event organizers and attendees.

---

## Feature 1: Event Creation

### Objective
Enable users to create detailed event listings with all necessary information via Telegram chat interface or a Web App.

### User Stories
- As an event organizer, I want to create a new event by providing essential details so potential attendees can learn about my event.
- As an event organizer, I want to edit event details after creation so I can update information as needed.
- As an event organizer, I want to set different ticket types and prices so I can offer various attendance options.

### User Flow
1. User sends `/create` command to the bot
2. Bot responds with two options:
   - "Create via chat" button
   - "Create via Web App" button
3. **Chat flow:**
   - Bot asks for event name (text input)
   - Bot asks for date and time (with date picker or text input)
   - Bot asks for location (text input)
   - Bot asks for description (text input)
   - Bot asks if this is a paid event (Yes/No buttons)
   - If paid, bot asks for ticket price (text input)
   - Bot asks for maximum attendees (text input)
   - Bot sends a preview of the event and asks for confirmation
   - User confirms and event is created
4. **Web App flow:**
   - Bot launches the Web App with a form containing all fields
   - User fills out the form and submits
   - Web App returns data to the bot
   - Bot creates the event and confirms with a message

### Bot Interaction Design

**Commands:**
- `/create` - Start event creation process
- `/edit <event_id>` - Edit an existing event

**Message Templates:**

```
üéâ Let's create a new event! 
How would you like to proceed?

[Create via chat] [Create via Web App]
```

```
üìù Please enter the event name:
```

```
üìÖ When will your event take place?
Please enter date and time (e.g., March 25, 2025 at 6:00 PM):
```

```
üìç Where will your event be held?
Please enter the location:
```

```
‚úèÔ∏è Please provide a description for your event:
```

```
üí∞ Is this a paid event?
[Yes] [No]
```

```
üíµ What is the ticket price? 
Please enter the amount in USD (e.g., 10.00):
```

```
üë• What is the maximum number of attendees?
Please enter a number (leave blank if unlimited):
```

```
‚úÖ Event Preview:

üìã Name: {event_name}
üìÖ Date: {event_date} at {event_time}
üìç Location: {event_location}
üí∞ Price: ${event_price}
üë• Capacity: {event_capacity}

üìù Description:
{event_description}

Is this correct?
[Confirm] [Edit]
```

### Backend Requirements

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/events` - Create new event
- `PUT /api/events/{event_id}` - Update existing event
- `GET /api/events/{event_id}` - Retrieve event details

**Business Logic:**
- Validate all inputs (date/time format, price format, max attendees)
- Generate unique event ID
- Store event in database
- Create calendar entry (iCal format)
- Initialize RSVP tracking

### Database Requirements

**Events Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    organizer_id BIGINT NOT NULL,  -- Telegram user ID
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    start_datetime TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    end_datetime TIMESTAMP,
    location VARCHAR(255),
    is_paid BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    max_attendees INTEGER,
    current_attendees INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    telegram_group_id BIGINT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Security & Validation
- Sanitize all text inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Validate date formats
- Ensure price is a valid decimal number
- Verify the user has permission to create events
- Rate limit event creation (e.g., max 10 per day per user)

### Edge Cases & Error Handling
- User provides invalid date/time format
- User sets unreasonable price (too high or too low)
- User cancels creation mid-process
- Network errors during creation
- Database transaction failures

### KPIs
- Number of events created per day/week/month
- Completion rate of event creation flow
- Average time to complete event creation
- Percentage of paid vs. free events

### Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Users abandon complex creation flow | Implement save draft functionality |
| Dates entered incorrectly | Provide date picker UI or clear format instructions |
| Spam events created | Implement verification for first-time organizers |

### Timeline Estimate
- Basic chat-based creation: 2-3 days
- Web App integration: 3-4 additional days
- Testing and refinement: 2 days
- Total: 7-9 developer days

---

## Feature 2: RSVP Tracking

### Objective
Enable users to confirm attendance to events via inline buttons, with automated tracking and updates for organizers.

### User Stories
- As an attendee, I want to RSVP to an event with a single click so I can confirm my attendance quickly.
- As an organizer, I want to see who has RSVP'd to my event so I can plan accordingly.
- As an attendee, I want to cancel my RSVP if my plans change so the organizer has accurate attendance information.

### User Flow
1. User views an event announcement (via bot, shared message, or channel)
2. User clicks "RSVP" button
3. For free events:
   - Bot confirms RSVP immediately
   - User receives confirmation message with event details
   - Organizer gets updated RSVP count
4. For paid events:
   - Bot initiates payment flow (see Ticket Payment feature)
   - RSVP is confirmed after successful payment
5. To cancel RSVP:
   - User clicks "Cancel RSVP" button on original message or sends `/cancel_rsvp <event_id>`
   - Bot confirms cancellation
   - For paid events, refund policy applies as configured by organizer

### Bot Interaction Design

**Commands:**
- `/rsvp <event_id>` - RSVP to an event
- `/cancel_rsvp <event_id>` - Cancel an RSVP
- `/my_events` - List events user has RSVP'd to

**Inline Buttons:**
- `[RSVP]` - On event announcements
- `[Cancel RSVP]` - On confirmed events
- `[View Attendees]` - For organizers

**Message Templates:**

```
üéüÔ∏è You're now RSVP'd for {event_name}!

üìÖ Date: {event_date} at {event_time}
üìç Location: {event_location}

We'll send you a reminder 24 hours before the event.
[View Details] [Cancel RSVP]
```

```
üìã RSVP Status for {event_name}:
‚úÖ Confirmed: {confirmed_count} / {max_attendees}
‚è≥ Pending: {pending_count}

[View Attendees] [Send Update]
```

```
‚ùå Your RSVP for {event_name} has been cancelled.
[RSVP Again]
```

### Backend Requirements

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/events/{event_id}/rsvps` - Create new RSVP
- `DELETE /api/events/{event_id}/rsvps/{user_id}` - Cancel RSVP
- `GET /api/events/{event_id}/rsvps` - Get all RSVPs for an event
- `GET /api/users/{user_id}/rsvps` - Get all events a user has RSVP'd to

**Business Logic:**
- Check if event has space before confirming RSVP
- For paid events, link RSVP to payment status
- Maintain waiting list if event is full
- Update event metrics after RSVP changes

### Database Requirements

**RSVPs Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE rsvps (
    rsvp_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    event_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES events(event_id),
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,  -- Telegram user ID
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,  -- 'confirmed', 'pending', 'cancelled'
    payment_id UUID,  -- Reference to payment if paid event
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(event_id, user_id)
);
```

### Security & Validation
- Verify event exists and is still open for RSVPs
- Check if user has already RSVP'd to prevent duplicates
- Ensure only the RSVP owner or event organizer can cancel an RSVP
- Validate that maximum attendees limit is not exceeded

### Edge Cases & Error Handling
- Event reaches capacity during RSVP attempt
- User tries to RSVP to a past event
- User tries to RSVP to the same event multiple times
- Organizer cancels event after RSVPs are made
- Payment failures for paid events

### KPIs
- RSVP conversion rate (views to RSVPs)
- RSVP cancellation rate
- Time between event creation and first RSVP
- RSVP distribution over time (early vs. last minute)

### Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| "No-shows" for free events | Send reminders and request confirmations |
| Large number of last-minute cancellations | Implement waiting list functionality |
| Multiple duplicate RSVP attempts | Use clear UI to show current RSVP status |

### Timeline Estimate
- RSVP functionality: 2 days
- Cancellation handling: 1 day
- Organizer views: 1 day
- Testing and refinement: 1 day
- Total: 5 developer days

## Feature 4: Telegram Group Automation

### Objective
Automatically create and manage private Telegram groups for events, with automatic invitations for confirmed attendees.

### User Stories
- As an organizer, I want a private group to be created for my event so attendees can connect before and during the event.
- As an organizer, I want paid/confirmed attendees to be automatically added to the event group so I don't have to manage invitations manually.
- As an attendee, I want to join the event's private group after RSVP so I can interact with other attendees.

### User Flow
1. When creating an event, organizer selects "Create private group" option
2. Bot automatically creates a private Telegram group
3. Bot adds itself and the organizer as administrators
4. When a user successfully RSVPs (and pays if required):
   - Bot generates an invite link
   - Bot sends invite link to the user
   - Alternatively, bot can directly add user to the group (requires user to have interacted with bot)
5. Bot sends welcome message to the group with event details
6. Post-event:
   - Bot can send follow-up messages
   - Organizer can decide to archive or continue the group

### Bot Interaction Design

**Commands:**
- `/group <event_id>` - Get invite link for event group (for organizers)
- `/broadcast <event_id> <message>` - Send message to all group members

**Message Templates:**

```
üè† A private group has been created for your event!

Event: {event_name}
Group: {group_name}

You have been added as an administrator.
[Open Group] [Invite Attendees]
```

```
üë• You've been invited to the private group for {event_name}!

Join the conversation with other attendees before the event.
[Join Group]
```

```
üëã Welcome to the {event_name} group!

üìÖ Date: {event_date} at {event_time}
üìç Location: {event_location}
üë• Current RSVPs: {confirmed_count} / {max_attendees}

This is a private group for confirmed attendees.
```

### Backend Requirements

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/events/{event_id}/group` - Create group for event
- `GET /api/events/{event_id}/group/invite` - Generate invite link
- `POST /api/events/{event_id}/group/message` - Send message to group

**Business Logic:**
- Create Telegram groups via Bot API
- Generate and track invite links
- Manage group permissions
- Track which users have been invited/joined
- Handle group lifecycle (creation, activity, archiving)

**Integrations:**
- Telegram Bot API for group management

### Database Requirements

**EventGroups Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE event_groups (
    group_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Telegram group ID
    event_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES events(event_id),
    group_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    invite_link TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**GroupMembers Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE group_members (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    group_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES event_groups(group_id),
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,  -- Telegram user ID
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,  -- 'invited', 'joined', 'left'
    invited_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    joined_at TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(group_id, user_id)
);
```

### Security & Validation
- Ensure bot has necessary permissions to create and manage groups
- Verify users have valid RSVPs before sending invites
- Protect against invite link sharing with non-attendees
- Rate limit group creation and invitation sends

### Edge Cases & Error Handling
- User has blocked the bot
- User has privacy settings that prevent adding to groups
- Group reaches Telegram member limit
- Bot loses admin permissions
- Network errors during group creation

### KPIs
- Group creation success rate
- Percentage of attendees who join groups
- Group activity (messages per day/week)
- Post-event group retention

### Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Users can't be added due to privacy settings | Use invite links as fallback |
| Group spam/abuse | Add moderation tools and reporting |
| Bot rate limits from Telegram | Implement queuing system for group actions |
| Confusion between multiple event groups | Clear naming convention and headers in groups |

# Telegram Event Bot - Key Features

## Feature 7: Organizer Dashboard

### Objective
Provide event organizers with comprehensive tools to manage events, track RSVPs, and communicate with attendees.

### User Stories
- As an organizer, I want to view all my events in one place so I can manage them efficiently.
- As an organizer, I want to see detailed RSVP and payment information so I can track event performance.
- As an organizer, I want to communicate with attendees easily so I can keep them updated.

### User Flow
1. Organizer sends `/dashboard` command to the bot
2. Bot responds with dashboard options
3. Organizer selects an event to manage
4. Bot displays management options for the selected event
5. Organizer performs actions like viewing RSVPs, sending updates, or editing event details

### Bot Interaction Design

**Commands:**
- `/dashboard` - Access organizer dashboard
- `/events` - List all events organized
- `/stats <event_id>` - View event statistics

**Message Templates:**

```
üéÆ Organizer Dashboard

You have {event_count} upcoming events.

What would you like to do?
[List My Events] [Create New Event] [View Analytics]

- As an organizer, I want to see user profiles and participation history so I can understand my audience better.
- As a user, I want to manage my personal information and privacy settings so I control what the bot knows about me.

### User Flow
1. User interacts with bot for the first time
2. Bot creates user record and welcomes new user
3. Bot gradually builds user profile through interactions
4. User can view and edit their profile via `/profile` command
5. Organizers can view limited user profiles of their event attendees

### Bot Interaction Design

**Commands:**
- `/profile` - View and edit user profile
- `/privacy` - Manage privacy settings
- `/history` - View participation history

**Message Templates:**

```
